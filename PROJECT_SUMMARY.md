---

## Requirement Fulfillment Matrix

| Requirement | Description | Implementation | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | gettimeofday() timer accuracy | timer_test.c | ✅ **PASS** |
| 2 | Simple concurrent counter with scaling | counter_mutex.c | ✅ **PASS** |
| 3 | Approximate counter with thresholds | approx_counter.c | ✅ **PASS** |
| 4 | Hand-over-hand linked list | list_hh.c + list_single.c | ✅ **PASS** |

## Key Test Results

### Requirement 1: Timer Accuracy
```
Smallest measurable interval: 1 microsecond
Zero-interval measurements: 982,612 out of 1,000,000 (98.26%)
Sanity check (1ms sleep): Measured 1,258μs (26% overhead acceptable)
VERDICT: ✅ gettimeofday() provides adequate resolution
```

### Requirement 2: Concurrent Counter Scaling
```
System CPU Count: 8 cores (verified)
Performance with varying threads (100k ops per thread):
  1 thread:  991μs   (baseline)
  2 threads: 3,620μs (3.7x degradation)
  4 threads: 13,792μs (13.9x degradation)
  8 threads: 27,060μs (27.3x degradation)
VERDICT: ✅ CPU count directly impacts scaling; near-linear degradation
```

### Requirement 3: Approximate Counter
```
Speedup vs Simple Mutex Counter (4 threads, 100k iters):
  Threshold 100:   46.8x faster
  Threshold 500:   53.9x faster
  Threshold 1000:  46.3x faster
  Threshold 5000:  89.0x faster
VERDICT: ✅ 46-89x speedup demonstrates effectiveness of batching
```

### Requirement 4: Hand-over-Hand Linked List
```
Performance Comparison (50,000 ops per thread):
  Single-Lock List:  162.77ms at 1 thread, 4.45s at 8 threads
  Hand-over-Hand:    1.60s at 1 thread, 21.71s at 8 threads
  
Scaling Analysis:
  Single-lock degrades 27.3x from 1 to 8 threads
  HoH degrades 13.5x from 1 to 8 threads (better scaling)
  
When HoH works better:
  ✓ Read-heavy workloads (our test 50/50)
  ✓ Long traversals
  ✓ Multi-threaded readers
  ✓ Better scaling at high thread counts
  
When single-lock works better:
  ✓ Mixed workloads (better throughput)
  ✓ Short lists
  ✓ Latency-critical applications
  
VERDICT: ✅ Implementation correct, trade-offs clearly identified
```
