Report - concurrent data structure experiments

This is a placeholder report. Run the benchmarks and collect timings; then fill in the tables and discussion here. Observations to include:
- Timer resolution from `timer_test`.
- Mutex counter scaling with threads and relation to CPU count (use `nproc` or `sysconf`).
- Approximate counter: effect of `threshold` on performance and accuracy.
- Hand-over-hand linked list: compare against single-lock list (not included) and discuss when coupling helps.
- Hash table: compare single global lock vs per-bucket locks; show graphs/tables.

Include collaboration statement and instructions for reproducing experiments.
