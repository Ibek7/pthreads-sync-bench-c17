COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS - All Requirements Fulfilled

=== REQUIREMENT 1: gettimeofday() Timer Accuracy ===

Objective: Measure timer accuracy and determine the smallest interval gettimeofday() can measure.

Implementation: timer_test.c runs 1,000,000 consecutive gettimeofday() calls and tracks:
- Number of zero-interval measurements
- Smallest observed non-zero interval

Results:
- Trials: 1,000,000
- Zero intervals: ~982,613 (98.26%)
- Smallest non-zero interval: 1 microsecond
- Sanity check (1ms select sleep): measured ~1,275 microseconds (accurate within ~27%)

Conclusion: gettimeofday() resolution on this macOS system is ~1 microsecond, though many
consecutive calls read the same time. The timer is sufficiently accurate for measuring
operations lasting milliseconds or longer.

=== REQUIREMENT 2: Simple Concurrent Counter with Thread Scaling ===

Objective: Build a simple concurrent counter and measure performance as thread count increases.
Also determine CPU count impact on scaling.

Implementation: counter_mutex.c uses a single pthread_mutex_t to protect counter increments.

System Information:
- CPU count: 8 cores (Apple Silicon M-series)

Results (100,000 increments per thread):
| Threads | Time (μs) | Per-op (ns) | Scaling |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1       | 1,001     | 10.0        | 1.0x    |
| 2       | 3,018     | 15.1        | 3.0x    |
| 4       | 12,803    | 32.0        | 12.8x   |
| 8       | 27,356    | 34.2        | 27.4x   |

Key Observations:
- Single-threaded performance: ~1ms for 100k increments
- Scaling is non-linear; time increases roughly linearly with thread count
- Lock contention dominates; many threads serialized behind mutex
- As thread count approaches CPU count (8), contention increases sharply
- Performance degradation at 8 threads suggests heavy serialization on shared lock

=== REQUIREMENT 3: Approximate Counter with Threshold Variation ===

Objective: Implement approximate counter to reduce contention via batching.
Measure performance impact of varying threshold values.

Implementation: approx_counter.c uses per-thread local counters and atomic global counter.
Each thread batches updates until local counter reaches threshold.

Results (4 threads, 100,000 iterations per thread):
| Threshold | Time (μs) | Per-op (ns) | Speedup vs Mutex |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 100       | 314       | 0.785       | 41x               |
| 500       | 140       | 0.350       | 86x               |
| 1,000     | 149       | 0.372       | 68x               |
| 5,000     | 138       | 0.345       | 93x               |

Key Observations:
- Approximate counter is orders of magnitude faster than mutex counter
- Performance relatively stable across threshold values (138-314 μs)
- Lower threshold (100) shows slightly higher overhead due to more atomic operations
- Higher thresholds (1000, 5000) provide good balance
- Speedup of 40-90x demonstrates effectiveness of reducing contention

=== REQUIREMENT 4: Hand-over-Hand Linked List Locking ===

Objective: Implement hand-over-hand locking (lock coupling) in a linked list.
Compare performance against single-lock baseline.
Identify when hand-over-hand works better.

Implementation:
- list_single.c: Single global pthread_mutex_t protecting entire list
- list_hh.c: Per-node locks with hand-over-hand (lock coupling) traversal

Results (50,000 ops per thread, 50% insert / 50% lookup on random values):

Single-Lock List:
| Threads | Time (μs)  | Per-op (μs) | Scaling |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 1       | 160,403   | 3.208      | 1.0x    |
| 2       | 672,334   | 6.723      | 4.2x    |
| 4       | 1,985,009 | 9.925      | 12.4x   |
| 8       | 4,428,995 | 11.072     | 27.6x   |

Hand-over-Hand List:
| Threads | Time (μs)  | Per-op (μs) | Scaling |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 1       | 1,619,919 | 32.398     | 1.0x    |
| 2       | 3,078,313 | 30.783     | 1.9x    |
| 4       | 5,498,518 | 27.492     | 3.4x    |
| 8       | 21,802,779| 54.506     | 13.5x   |

Analysis:

1. Single-thread Performance:
   - Single-lock list: 160ms (faster baseline)
   - Hand-over-hand list: 1,620ms (10x slower)
   - Hand-over-hand overhead: per-node lock management, acquisition/release per traversal step

2. Multi-thread Scaling:
   - Single-lock: Linear degradation (28x slower with 8 threads)
   - Hand-over-hand: Sub-linear initially, then worse at 8 threads (13.5x slower)
   - At 8 threads, hand-over-hand becomes significantly worse

3. When Hand-over-Hand Helps:
   - NOT recommended for this random-access workload
   - Single-lock list shows better scaling up to 4 threads
   - Hand-over-hand degrades faster at 8 threads

4. Conditions Where Hand-over-Hand Would Help:
   - Read-heavy workloads (our test is 50/50)
   - Range queries with long traversals
   - When list needs to be walked from head without modification
   - Workload where multiple readers traverse different parts of list
   - Low contention scenarios with fine-grained reader concurrency

Conclusion: For this random insert/lookup workload, the single-lock approach is
superior. Hand-over-hand locking is useful for specific patterns (long read traversals,
read-dominated workloads) not present in this benchmark.

=== ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATIONS (Beyond Requirements) ===

Hash Table Performance (included for completeness):
- hash_single.c: Single global lock for entire table
- hash_buckets.c: Per-bucket locks (32,768 buckets)

Results show per-bucket locking provides ~5.5x speedup over global lock,
demonstrating effectiveness of finer-grained locking for data structures
with natural partitioning.
